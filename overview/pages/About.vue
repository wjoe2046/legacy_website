<h3>Our Project</h3>

<p>COVID-19 has a relatively long infectious incubation period, averaging five days but potentially up to two weeks, during which there may be asymptomatic transmission. In other words, there may be a period of time in which people who carry COVID-19 don&#39;t necessarily show symptoms and may not even realise they are infected, but are still capable of infecting others. This makes it harder for health professionals and epidemiologists to trace who has come into contact with infected persons (&#39;contact tracing&#39;), which in turn makes the virus more difficult to effectively contain.</p>

<p>Many people, however, now carry GPS-enabled smartphones which already track their location over time - most mapping apps, like Google Maps or MapQuest, already collect this data by default. We believe that this information could be used to rapidly and automatically perform a type of contact tracing, helping limit the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. These phones are usually also Bluetooth-enabled, allowing them to track and record which other phones they&#39;re in proximity to.</p>

<p>We believe that together, these two pieces of information can be used to inform and empower our users in a range of ways. Firstly, we can generate heatmaps of high-risk areas from demographic data, known cases, and epidemiological modelling, allowing users to adjust their behaviour accordingly. Secondly, we can use Bluetooth connections between users to enact <a href="http://covid-watch.org/CSCT.pdf">cryptographically secure contact tracing</a> and alerting them if we learn that they have been exposed to COVID-19, without revealing the identities or infection status of any other users.</p>

<h3>Our Principles</h3>

<p><b>(1) Privacy: </b>Tracking is a sensitive issue, especially in a project like ours that necessitates some degree of data sharing to be effective. This is why we&#39;re absolutely committed to building an app that goes out of its way to respect and preserve your privacy.<br />
In fact, that&#39;s a big part of why we&#39;re building this app in the first place. Superficially similar (but far more invasive) projects are already being trialled around the world - we decided that it would be a good idea to have a transparent, not-for-profit alternative that has privacy baked into it from the very beginning.</p>

<p><b>(2) Efficacy: </b>With such high stakes, we want to be absolutely sure that we&#39;re using our time and energy wisely. We aren&#39;t aiming to take focus away from more directly impactful work like vaccine development or front-line healthcare, and we recommend that you only help our project if it doesn&#39;t detract from more important work elsewhere. Additionally, we&#39;re on the lookout for overlapping work by groups with similar values, to avoid reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p><b>(3) Altruism: </b>This project has its roots in <b><a class="blue" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a></b>: doing the most good that we can with what we have. We&#39;re not here to make a profit, get famous, or push an ideology. We&#39;re a group of volunteers doing this out of a desire to make the world a better place - for us, and for you.</p>

<h3>Our Timeline</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve recruited a strong team, successfully developed an internal proof of concept, and formalised a strong theoretical basis for what we want to do. Our next steps are tentatively planned as follows, contingent on no insurmountable obstacles appearing:</p>

<p><strong>One Week (by 17-MAR-2020): </strong>Have a beta app completed, available for external audiences. This will have at least Bluetooth contact tracing functionality. Approach public health agencies regarding collaboration and authenticating infection data.</p>

<p><strong>One to Two Weeks (by 24-MAR-2020): </strong>Further refine our epidemiological modelling and heatmap functionality, addressing privacy issues around data reidentification.&nbsp; Finalise the beta app.</p>

<p><strong>Two to Four Weeks (by mid-April 2020): </strong>Roll out the app in impacted communities as a pilot program in conjunction with public health agencies, refining and adding functionality as needed. Assess efficacy and make adjustments as needed.</p>
