                  <h2>Summary Article: 20th of March 2020</h2>

                  <p>
                    Rather than an ordinary blog post, this is what much of our
                    team have been working on for most of the past week. This is
                    a comprehensive summary of our project, now named COVID
                    Watch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It covers the what, why, how, when, and where of this
                    project in detail, as well as discusses our progress so far.
                    The aim of doing so is to assist interested parties and
                    organisations in becoming familiar with the project in its
                    entirety. If that sounds like you, this is the place to
                    start.

                    This project is now roughly two and a half weeks old, and in
                    that time we&#39;ve made significant progress - not just
                    into solving the problems we&#39;d begun with, but in
                    understanding which problems we should be trying to solve in
                    the first place. We have a far deeper understanding of the
                    technologies and challenges.

                  <p>
                    Today&#39;s post comes from Tina White, a PhD candidate from
                    Stanford University specialising in applied machine learning
                    research. She&#39;s the main organiser here at the COVID-19
                    Risk App: the below post is a lightly edited version of an
                    internal document. Much of the technical content mentioned
                    has been covered in other blog posts: instead, the insight
                    here is how our project organises and plans...<br />

                    It takes multiple GPS trajectories and runs multiple
                    epidemiological simulations on them based on an assumption

                    Welcome to our first insight post!<br />
                    In this series, our researchers will share what they&#39;re
                    currently working on and the challenges they&#39;re facing.
                    They will be more technical than our progress posts, but as
                    the name suggests they will hopefully provide some insight
                    into the state of the project.<br />
