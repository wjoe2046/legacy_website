    <p>We&#39;ve grown from a pair of researchers from Stanford University and the University of Waterloo into an interdisciplinary team
    of researchers, software engineers, public health and security experts. But we still need more help. We are looking for
    more volunteers to join us and help us build an app that uses crowdsourced data to inform individuals of their
    risk and slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>

    <p>(4) Volunteer Recruiter - get the word out, bring more people onto our team, then get them situated and productive quickly</p>

    <h3>Support Roles</h3>

    <p>Even if you don&#39;t have a skillset directly related to the project&#39;s design or development, there are still ways to help. We&#39;re a rapidly expanding group, and we&#39;re also interested if you have experience in:</p>

    <p>(1) Fundraising and grant applications for not-for-profit organisations</p>

    <p>(2) PR and Outreach</p>

    <p>(3) Blogging, particularly with a scientific background</p>

    <p>(4) Onboarding and orientation into organisations</p>

    <h3>Research Roles</h3>

    <p>(1) General mobile app UI design (iOS and/or Android)</p>

    <p>(2) Advanced web development skills, particularly in interactive visualisations</p>

    <h3>Applying</h3>

    <p>If you know of anyone who could fill these roles, get them to email us at <b><a class="blue" href="mailto: contact@covid-watch.org">contact@covid-watch.org </a></b>.</p>

    <p>We recommend you read the <b><a class="blue" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8chk6DHZXctGHtNoz/covid-19-risk-assessment-app-idea-for-vetting-and-discussion">forum post </a></b> to have the context to understand what you&#39;d be working on and the motivations behind the project. The post was optimistic about what could be accomplished in a short time period, and we are no longer sure about providing scores and recommendations, but we think we may be able to build the heat map referenced in the post with help from other researchers.</p>

    <p>If you&#39;re interested in collaborating and have one of the skillsets listed above, please contact us at <b><a class="blue" href="mailto: contact@covid-watch.org">contact@covid-watch.org </a></b> with the role you would like to fill and a brief (~300 words) introduction with your skills and links to previous work.</p>

    <p>We're also interested if you have information that you think could be relevant to this project. In particular, we are interested in any other teams that are currently, or were previously, engaged in similar efforts.</p>
