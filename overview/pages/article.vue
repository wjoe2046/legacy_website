          <p>
            We are a group of volunteers — researchers, software engineers,
            privacy and public health experts — who have developed a
            privacy-preserving mobile app intervention to reduce the spread of
            COVID-19. Our mobile app performs automatic decentralized contact
            tracing using Bluetooth proximity networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our volunteers care strongly about preserving human life and human
            rights. All data we could collect is voluntary and fully anonymized.
            All code is transparent. It is
            <a href="https://github.com/covid19risk/"><span>open source</span></a

              the planet.</span

          </p>
          <p>
            <span
              >The app could be installed by anyone with a Bluetooth-capable
              smartphone, alerting them to their risk of having been in contact
              with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and helping them to protect
              themselves and their friends, families, and other contacts
              altruistically.</span

              helpful in communities where contact tracing resources are too
              limited to match the scope of the pandemic. We're building this app
              to provide components and tools that public health agencies can use
              to supplement their pre-existing efforts to fight COVID-19, assisted
              by voluntary public action.&nbsp;</span

              intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, invasive
              interventions carry significant human rights costs, including the
              temporary loss of personal freedom and fears around whether that
              freedom will be restored.</span

            <span

              efficacy because people will be more likely to share accurate data
              if they know that data is safe. Ensuring privacy prevents COVID-19
              patients from being ostracized or socially harmed on account of
              inadvertent potential data exposures. Also, mobile apps with poor
              privacy models may further undermine public confidence in responses
              and exacerbate existing mistrust.&nbsp;</span

              Using the app, users can alert recent contacts without anyone being
              able to trace the information back to them. We believe this

              phone GPS history, surveillance cameras, and credit card records
              then send text alerts with the location history of patients. Much
              like the intervention in China, this appears to be effective, but

          </p>
          <p>
            Non-pharmaceutical pandemic interventions fundamentally make a
            trade-off between two important social goods: (1) loss of life from
            the pandemic and (2) economic impact, which influences health and
            well-being outcomes indirectly. Mobile app interventions are a
            powerful public health tool because they can improve this trade-off.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, non-pharmaceutical approaches to infectious disease
            control have the following components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Filtering (picking a subset of the population)</li>
            <li>Intervention (modifying the behaviour of these people)</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            For example, quarantining patients with a positive diagnosis applies a
            filter based on testing and then applies the quarantine intervention.
            Other examples include travel restrictions for at-risk areas,
            cancelling public events in a specific city, or encouraging more
            handwashing in an entire country. Some of these interventions,
            especially self-isolation, are
            <a
              href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30074-7/fulltext"
              >highly effective</a
            >
            at preventing the transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19.
            The downside is that they can also be costly to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The quality of filtering plays a crucial role in determining the
            trade-off between loss of life and economic impact. If filtering is
            poor, a correspondingly larger economic impact will be needed to
            achieve the same loss of life reduction. Without good filtering, broad
            quarantines and social distancing are needed, incurring a huge cost in
            the form of negative impact on people’s lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, traditional approaches to filtering, such as contact
            tracing, are labor intensive and don’t scale well. So we expect
            filtering (and, correspondingly, the trade-off between loss of life
            and economic impact) to degrade in quality as a pandemic grows. But
            automated contact tracing solutions have the potential to be more
            scalable -- and potentially even more accurate, with access to higher
            quality information than traditional contact tracing. This may allow
            for a better trade-off to be maintained in the midst of a pandemic.
          </p>

          <p>
            The system proposed here is intended to be used as part of a broader
            campaign to combat COVID-19. These methods focus on gathering and
            disseminating the information needed to perform targeted
            interventions.

          <p>
            There are three components to this system that work almost
            independently, but can be bundled into a single mobile app. Depending
            on privacy requirements and the needs of specific public health
            authorities a subset of these capabilities could be utilized.

            Non-pharmaceutical methods focused on social distancing reduce the
            spread of COVID-19. These methods are based on reducing contact
            between infected and susceptible people, even when it isn’t known who
            is infected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the simplest form, this is being achieved by reducing all social
            events and increasing precautions like handwashing. This is an
            effective measure because the number of new infections is roughly
            proportional to the number of contact events with infectious people.
          </p>

            A more targeted approach employed by many health agencies is

            of the entire US population estimated to own one. Bluetooth is a radio
            protocol that can be used to wirelessly communicate between nearby
            mobile devices and the signal strength can be used to estimate
            distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile devices can be made to proactively record contact events with
            other nearby devices by sending Bluetooth signals. By measuring the
            signal strength and discrete number of contact events, the duration
            and distance of contact between two phone users can be estimated.
          </p>
          <p>
            By recording all contact events, a high accuracy list of at-risk
            individuals can be generated automatically when a new person is
            diagnosed. These individuals can then be immediately notified to
            ensure they self-isolate before infecting more people.

            While GPS data is a more well-known general technology, there are
            significant advantages bluetooth has over GPS in terms of accuracy for
            contact tracing. With bluetooth, proximity can be approximated by
            signal strength that is reduced by obstructions like walls; therefore,
            it more accurately reflects functional proximity in high-risk
            environments for close contact: inside buildings, in vehicles and
            airplanes, and in underground transit.

              Bluetooth communication also occurs directly between mobile devices.
              This means a decentralized system can be built more easily with and
              with stronger privacy protection than other crowdsourcing data types
              like GPS trajectories.

            device users could be integrated under a single system, outcomes could
            be further improved over more global communities.

            The Bluetooth contact tracing system can be structured in a
            decentralized and anonymous way using randomly generated and locally
            stored ‘Contact Event Numbers’. This allows the system to function
            fully without any private information being stored or transmitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            By generating a new random number for each contact event, the system
            is able to operate without storing or transmitting any personal
            information. This method is designed so that only the phones involved
            in a contact event are able to identify messages on a public database.

            The only authentication required is the permission number provided by
            a public health authority. This permission number is used so that
            malicious actors cannot send false alarms. After authentication the
            permission number is deleted from server memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contact event numbers are random and only known by the message
            recipient and the message sender, so the database can be made public
            without risk of sensitive information being discovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            While our current intervention is based on permission numbers, in
            regions where widespread testing is unavailable, a well-designed
            symptom sharing questionnaire may perform a similar function, with a
            higher number of false positives. Research in this direction is
            currently being done by the
            <a href="https://www.CoEpi.org">CoEpi</a> team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most effective form of this intervention would occur in
            communities that implement widespread testing and where permission
            numbers are shared with the mobile app by public health departments.

            The specification for the database is very simple: it is shared across

            Numbers. If protections against hoaxes are required, permission
            numbers can be used, but are not an essential requirement of the
            system. If the database grows too large, it can also be fragmented
            based on general location. The code and a more in depth discussion of
            architecture are available on the open source github repo

          <p><span class="subTitleLine">Implementation</span></p>
          <p>
            Bluetooth contact tracing is implemented via background processes on
            iOS and Android.
          </p>
          <p>
            The approach currently being investigated utilizes BLE functionality
            for background advertisement and scanning. Due to different system
            requirements for Android and iOS, the protocol works differently
            depending on the operating systems of the devices involved. The key
            challenges are:
          </p>
          <ul class="decimal">
            <li>
              iOS devices acting as “peripherals” in the background can only be
              found by “centrals” that are scanning for their specific service
              UUID. These peripherals must establish a connection to transfer any
              data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Android devices have several unfixed bugs where subsequent
              connections with many devices can cause the Bluetooth system to lock
              up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            The current solution is a hybrid model that is asymmetric for
            communication between iOS and Android. All devices will simultaneously
            act as peripherals and centrals, but only some devices will be able to
            detect others, and only some devices will need to establish a
            connection to exchange data. An extended description of the
            communication model and the code are available on github here
            <a href="https://github.com/covid19risk/covidwatch-ios">for iOS </a>
            and

              >for Android</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            This model has been successfully implemented as a proof-of-concept, as
            shown below:

            March 31, 2020 update: We initially planned to create a GPS-based risk heatmap, as
            described in this section. However, GPS anonymization has proven to be a far more
            challenging problem than Bluetooth anonymization. GPS likely requires significant
            privacy trade-offs. Also, based on feedback from contact tracers, fomite risk
            (transmission of infectious disease by objects like door handles, etc.) is considerably
            lower than close contact risk, and it's unlikely to be captured prior to testing
            confirmation. As such, GPS data has become a lower priority for us, and we have decided
            not to implement this component until we are confident we can do so in a way that
            preserves the privacy of our users.
          </v-alert>

          <p>
            <a class="anchor" id="heatmapDesc"></a>
            <span class="subTitleLine">Model Description</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            GPS capability is ubiquitous among smartphone devices, and
            high-resolution spatiotemporal data is regularly used by mapping and
            social media apps. Given anonymized GPS data along with user infection
            status, we can approximately calculate where the fomite-based risk of
            infection is the highest; meaning, where there may be inanimate
            objects capable of transmitting infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anonymized GPS data can inform an epidemiological model to show how
            the disease is likely to spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this epidemiological model, we can generate a risk heatmap
            showing comparative fomite risk for different geographical areas. This
            heatmap enables our users to adjust their behaviours in response to
            their local environment. They could, for example, choose to take extra
            precautions when in high-risk areas, or avoid them altogether. This
            both decreases the risk of our users becoming infected, and decreases
            the risk that they will infect those around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            This provides a supplementary service for our users to inform their
            social distancing measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is an example heatmap created by running our epidemiology model
            using simulated data:

          <HeatmapModelInteractive class="heatMap"></HeatmapModelInteractive>

          <p>
            The source code at time of writing [19-MAR-2020] of the
            epidemiological model can be found and is available open source
            <a

              >here</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            To describe it simply, the heat map builds upon SEIR models and
            simulates users according to the following state machine:
          </p>
          <div class="centerImage">
            <img
              style="width: 70%"

              alt=""
            />
          </div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            The population of simulated users, and probability and timing of a
            simulated user moving from one state to the next, are generated from
            the data we have available: both on the background demographics of
            impacted areas and specific case data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each simulated user is given an age and has a chance of having
            pre-existing health conditions, which impact their contagiousness and
            susceptibility to infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The anonymized user trajectories are superimposed over a grid covering
            the area being modelled, while the grid squares are filled with a
            number of randomly generated simulated humans based off demographic
            data for that area. As simulated infected and contagious users move
            across the grid, they carry a chance of infecting the other simulated
            humans (both user and non-user) sharing their grid space at any given
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simulated non-user humans also have a probability of adjusting their
            behaviour and movement throughout the simulation, to model hospital
            admission and self-isolation.

            This simulation is run multiple times, and the amount of time each
            infected human spent in each grid square contributes to its overall
            risk score, which is represented by the final heatmap.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our understanding of COVID-19 progresses, this heatmap can be
            refined, and the parameters tuned to more accurately reflect
            real-world data.

            Given the personally identifying nature of the spatiotemporal
            trajectories provided by GPS systems, this information will be handled
            in a more complex way involving two distinct servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first server, Server A, will handle anonymization using the
            methods described in the <em>Heatmap Privacy Model</em> section
            above. Users will send their GPS data to Server A first without any
            other information, and Server A will return the now-anonymized data to
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            They will then upload the anonymized data, along with their infection
            status, to the second server, Server B. Server B will take this data
            and add it to our epidemiological simulation, generating a heatmap.

          </p>
          <p>
            The heatmap may either require the application of an anonymization
            algorithm, or the explicit consent of users to publish high resolution
            GPS trajectories. This choice will need to be made in consultation
            with regulators. The advisory system will make use of the information
            generated by the other two methods and information from public health
            offices. It can be structured so no additional patient data needs to
            be collected, but making suggestions more complicated than ‘call your
            local public health department’ may require additional regulatory
            approval.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a large body of academic work behind the anonymization of
            spatiotemporal data, most of which draw from a handful of common
            strategies. These include aggregating multiple similar trajectories
            together, decreasing the resolution of each datapoint across space and
            time, removing particularly distinctive datapoints, and swapping
            sections of trajectories that cross paths.
          </p>
          <p>
            One widely accepted metric for de-identification of data is
            k-anonymization. A dataset is anonymous for some integer k if no entry
            can be narrowed down further than belonging to one of k individuals.
            For example, a group of trajectories would be 3-anonymous if each
            trajectory could plausibly belong to at least 3 individuals. Our aim
            is to create a dataset with the maximum possible k-value that still
            preserves utility. The worst-case scenario we would be willing to
            publish is at minimum a 10-anonymous dataset with respect to an
            adversary using commonly available geographical information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the urgency of the situation, we intend to use contractual
            boundaries against deanonymization rather than aiming to protect
            against more sophisticated and hypothetical attacks on our
            anonymization scheme. Building anonymity systems that are resistant to
            more sophisticated attacks is challenging, and takes much more time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The anonymization model we are implementing is one created by
            researchers from the University of Montréal
            <a
              href="https://www.academia.edu/24040759/Anonymizing_trajectory_data_for_passenger_flow_analysis"
              >(Ghazemzadeh et al 2014)</a
            >. It allows for flexible k-anonymity without significant distortion,
            and has a proven and open-source implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does require a significant number of trajectories to be
            significant, so we will be supplementing our initial database with
            plausible synthetic trajectories created by the
            <a href="https://iapg.jade-hs.de/personen/brinkhoff/generator/"
              >Brinkhoff trajectory generator</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The end result is that the trajectories being used to generate our
            heatmap can be mathematically verified to be anonymous, guaranteeing
            the privacy of our users.

            suggest that with extensive testing, accurate contact tracing, and

          <p>
            For intermediate testing and contact tracing detection rates, a system
            like this would likely need to be used in combination with social
            distancing measures and manual contact tracing. However, the measures
            suggested by
            <a
              href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf"
              >Ferguson et al</a
            >. could potentially be relaxed if supplemented with sufficient
            targeted interventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the three target parameters (tracing accuracy, detection rate, base
            transmission), the potential influence of the app on tracing accuracy
            is the simplest to quantify. Any two users of the app who are at the
            same location at the same time will register a contact event. In
            theory, all transmission events except those by fomites would be
            detected. This includes all types of contact classified as being
            <a
              href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-public-health-management-contact-novel-coronavirus-cases-EU.pdf"
              >“high risk” by the ECDC</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preventative measures encouraged by the app such as avoiding high-risk
            areas and increased precautions would reduce overall transmission
            rate, however it is difficult to quantify this impact. The current
            design of the app may also increase detection rate by informing users
            of symptoms to watch for and how to get tested. Ongoing research is
            being conducted on how to allocate testing resources to maximize the
            expected value of secondary cases detected.
          </p>
          <p>
            To have a significant impact the technology will require a significant
            adoption rate. To detect contact events using Bluetooth both
            individuals must have the app installed at the time of transmission.
            Assuming ‘P’ percent of the population uses the app, ‘A’ percent of
            transmission events between app users are detected, and ‘T’ percent of
            infected are tested, then T*A*P^2 percent of total transmissions are
            detected (if app users are homogeneous in the population).
          </p>
          <p>
            The figure below examines the percentage of detectable transmission
            events in countries with different testing rates as a function of app
            usage. The analysis assumes that these events are uncorrelated, which
            may significantly under-estimate detected transmissions due to missing
            chain-reaction testing. Ongoing modelling work is being done to
            investigate the dynamics of rapid tracing and testing along infection
            chains.

            In order to investigate disease dynamics with clusters of app users,
            the model developed by Hellewel et al was modified to account for two
            sub-populations, one that uses the app and another that doesn’t. The
            modified implementation is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/covid19risk/impact-sim">Github</a> and
            currently assumes 90% app tracing accuracy and 50% non-app tracing
            accuracy (assuming health systems are partially overwhelmed).
          </p>
          <p>
            This model was used to estimate the average number of infections
            caused in 6 weeks due to a single imported case. Results show a
            significant reduction in risk for clusters of app users that are
            partially distanced from non app users. This is important because it
            provides an additional incentive for individuals to use the app even
            when the overall adoption rate is low. As the proportion of the
            population using the app increases the risk for the entire population
            is reduced and most outbreaks are contained.

            The answer seems to be yes. With a comprehensive testing program, high
            contact tracing accuracy, and self-isolation of diagnosed individuals,
            our models predict that each new case could cause on the order of 10
            other cases before the outbreak is extinguished. Even in parameter
            regimes where automated contact tracing alone is not enough, this
            technology can be used in combination with existing methodologies to
            provide greater protections with lower social cost.

            <span class="subTitleLine"> Timeline to Deployment</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We estimate we could complete the remainder of the necessary technical
            requirements and deploy the first version of the mobile app for pilot
            within 2 weeks, and possibly sooner, based on the rapid rate of
            progress that has so far been achieved by the researchers and
            volunteers who have devoted their time to this technically
            challenging, but potentially high impact intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            The track to development requires (1) more volunteers to help us with
            skill sets listed on our
            <nuxt-link to="/collaborate">collaborate page</nuxt-link>
            and (2) funding for, at a minimum, cloud services.
          </p>
          <p>The app will be implemented and launched in two parts:</p>
          <ul class="decimal">
            <li>
              The first version will implement a Bluetooth proximity
              system to notify users of potential
              close contact exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second version will build upon the initial launch. Users may be
              able to self-report symptoms, receive personalized advice based on
              the local health department, and receive CDC advice and resources
              (Fig. 1). When users come in contact with someone with COVID-19 or
              symptoms of it, their phones will send them a push notification of
              the alert. Users could then see their Transmission Phone Log within
              the application to determine where and when they may have contracted
              the virus. Additional features include incorporating a
              locally-stored questionnaire noting recent travel and symptoms to
              better determine the user’s risk level (Fig. 2).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            We also want to emphasize that high user adoption as quickly as
            possible after release will facilitate the best possible outcomes for
            intervention. Historical data from Bluetooth contact
            events doesn’t exist. Therefore, a user needs to download the app in
            order to start the clock and begin benefiting from the system as it
            anonymously logs their Bluetooth contact events.

          <h2><span class="titleLine">Conclusions</span></h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mobile technologies can provide instantaneous and high accuracy
            contact tracing, even between strangers at low social and economic
            cost. Instead of requiring thousands of healthcare workers to do this
            manually (as is the current approach in China) the process will be
            essentially cost-free. Also, because the system will be so accurate, a
            majority of people can continue to live their lives without the need
            for increased social distancing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are developing this technology as a high-quality filter to be used
            for the pandemic optimization problem. Combined with a comprehensive
            testing program, our filter may be powerful enough to stop further
            spread of COVID-19.
