          <h1>Why we're integrating Bluetooth data into our app</h1>
        </div>

        <h3>March 7 2020</h3>

        <p>
          This project is now roughly two and a half weeks old, and in that time
          we&#39;ve made significant progress - not just into solving the
          problems we&#39;d begun with, but in understanding which problems we
          should be trying to solve in the first place. We have a far deeper
          understanding of the technologies and challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases now over
          100 000, it&#39;s become increasingly apparent that time is absolutely
          essential if we want to make a difference now.
        </p>

        <p>
          We&#39;ve encountered what seemed like insurmountable barriers in
          complying with HIPAA regulations, but out of that struggle we&rsquo;ve
          gained a lot. We&rsquo;re now confident about a solution that we
          believe could fight the spread of the virus, comply with HIPAA, and
          preserve user privacy in more effective ways and more quickly than we
          had originally envisioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the last blog post, we talked about the addition of Bluetooth into
          the project. This post discusses in more detail what that means, why
          we&rsquo;re doing it, how it compares to other projects, and how we
          will secure the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin with, a recap: in addition to our work on GPS heatmapping,
          we&rsquo;ve decided to integrate Bluetooth data. Specifically, we will
          give our users who have contracted COVID-19 the ability to alert
          others who have been in their proximity that they might have been
          exposed, without revealing who they are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, the measure of proximity we could get from Bluetooth is a better
          measure than we could get from GPS data alone, so the addition of
          Bluetooth will improve our map accuracy too.
        </p>

        <h3>Why we&rsquo;re integrating Bluetooth</h3>

        <p>
          There are a few advantages Bluetooth has over GPS. It&rsquo;s blocked
          by walls, therefore more accurately reflecting functional proximity:
          for example, two people in the same room would be seen as at higher
          infection risk than in neighbouring rooms, while GPS would simply
          record them as being the same distance apart. It works in places where
          GPS doesn&rsquo;t work very well: inside buildings and in underground
          transit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps most exciting to us, Bluetooth can also be implemented in a
          decentralized way that absolutely ensures the privacy of our users by
          not giving anyone identifiable information - including us. Our
          anonymous Bluetooth database would only be interpretable by the
          individual phones that connect to it, and they would only be
          interpreting the lines of the database relevant to them - it would not
          be interpretable by a human being. This is great news in its own
          right, but what makes it particularly appealing is that this should
          allow us to guarantee that we comply with HIPAA.
        </p>

        <p>
          HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
          1996, is the set of rules that dictate how health information is
          stored and handled in the United States. Other nations have equivalent
          laws, but as a predominantly US-based project that&rsquo;s affiliated
          with US institutions, HIPAA is the most relevant. Additionally, many
          of these sets of laws are broadly similar, so HIPAA compliance will
          set us up well for expansion to other countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          On one hand, HIPAA is great. It does a broadly excellent job of
          managing confidentiality and personal health information, and lays out
          a range of robust protections for patients. If you&rsquo;re living in
          America and have seen your own medical file, benefited from
          confidentiality when discussing medical conditions with your doctor,
          or had important information restored from a backup, you can likely
          thank HIPAA. As a privacy-focused project, these are things we can
          definitely support.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, it&rsquo;s a complex package of rules that have
          become even more complex as institutions have adapted their own
          internal processes to conform to them. For a large hospital or
          university with extensive legal resources and in-house subject matter
          experts, this may not present a large obstacle, but for a small
          volunteer team like ours it does.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specifically, the issue is that our project deals with health
          information (infection status) and is in some ways affiliated with
          institutions bound by HIPAA: we&rsquo;re receiving advice from several
          academics on the payroll of American and Canadian universities. GPS
          data may be counted as a personally identifying piece of information
          under some interpretations of the law, which further complicates our
          obligations.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn&rsquo;t necessarily the end of the story: getting explicit
          user consent may circumvent these obligations, or an organizational
          &lsquo;firewall&rsquo; between the app development and academic advice
          sections of the project. The simplest and most surefire way at this
          stage, however, seems to be adopting Bluetooth contact recording,
          which does not contain personally identifying information. In doing
          so, we both significantly cut down on the time until our app gets into
          useful hands, and make it far easier for institutions like
          universities or the CDC to work with us.
        </p>

        <h3>What we&rsquo;re doing</h3>

        <p>
          We&rsquo;ve talked in broad terms about what we aim to do, but what do
          we actually mean? What, specifically, will our Bluetooth functionality
          do?
        </p>

        <p>Let&#39;s start off with a metaphor.</p>

        <p>
          Imagine phones as people. You&rsquo;re one of them: specifically,
          you&rsquo;re a phone with our app installed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          Some of the people around you also have the app. You can tell, because
          every few minutes they pipe up with &lsquo;I have the app!&rsquo;, and
          everybody nearby can hear them.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          When you hear one of these calls, you have a private conversation with
          a curtain pulled up between you where you pick a completely random
          word - let&rsquo;s say &lsquo;primeval&rsquo;. You write it down in
          your own personal journal under today&#39;s date along with the suburb
          that you met, and go on with your day, and the person you were talking
          to does the same in their own journal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly, you have no idea who this person is, and
          <strong>they have no idea who you are</strong>: you just know that
          they also have the app and they were in the same room as you. They
          could even have been someone you&rsquo;ve met more than once before -
          it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference. Each time you meet, you make a
          new entry.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          You do this for everyone you meet who also has the app. At the end of
          the day, your journal looks something like this:
        </p>

        <p>
          THURSDAY<br />
          Kumquat: in North Wollongong<br />
          Temple: in Wollongong Central<br />
          Eucalyptus: in Coniston<br />
          Afternoon: in Mt Warrigal<br />
          Primeval: in Haywards Bay<br />
          Speaker: in Port Kembla<br />
          Cookery: in Coniston
        </p>

        <p>
          And so on. Again, you don&rsquo;t know anything about the person you
          met with, and
          <strong>they don&rsquo;t know anything about you</strong>: you just
          know that you met with somebody on a certain day in a broad area.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the day, one of our users confirmed that they&rsquo;ve been
          diagnosed with COVID-19. They gave us their journal, and we&rsquo;ve
          published the random words online.
          <strong>These words are completely meaningless to us</strong>: they
          only mean something to the two people who decided on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          That evening, you log on to covid-watch.org and check the list. It
          looks like this:
        </p>

        <p>
          Yarn<br />
          Language<br />
          Credit<br />
          Riddle<br />
          Sad<br />
          Tempt<br />
          Afternoon<br />
          Ruthless
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh no! You recognise one of those words: your journal has an entry
          under &lsquo;Afternoon&rsquo;, from Thursday in the suburb of Mt
          Warrigal. Whoever that person was, you now know that they were
          infectious and you&rsquo;re at risk. It&rsquo;s time to
          self-quarantine, contact your local health authorities, and get
          yourself tested.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s say that your test comes back positive too: you have
          COVID-19. Don&rsquo;t panic - thanks to the app, it was picked up
          early and your prospects are good. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to pass
          the favour on: along with your test results, you get an envelope from
          your doctor and use it to send us your journal. Importantly,
          <strong>we don&rsquo;t know who you are</strong>: all the information
          we have is that somebody has been diagnosed by a doctor, and their
          journal word entry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, we take your journal and add the words from it onto our
          publicly available list, which now looks like this:
        </p>

        <p>
          Yarn<br />
          Language<br />
          Credit<br />
          Riddle<br />
          Sad<br />
          Tempt<br />
          Afternoon<br />
          Ruthless<br />
          Kumquat<br />
          Temple<br />
          Eucalyptus<br />
          Primeval<br />
          Speaker<br />
          Cookery
        </p>

        <p>
          Now everybody else with the app can look at the list, and anybody
          who&rsquo;s interacted with you can take appropriate measures as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, we take the date of the interaction and add it to our
          epidemiological heatmap and model. We use this data to generate a
          heatmap showing everyone with the app which areas are higher- or
          lower-risk for COVID-19: high-risk areas are more likely to have
          contaminated surfaces, for example, and you should be especially
          careful about hygiene while there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Importantly,
          <strong
            >this location information is vague and cannot be traced back to
            you</strong
          >: all we know is which suburbs you&rsquo;ve been in, each of which
          contain thousands of people. The final heatmap is deliberately made
          vague in order to add an extra layer of privacy preservation, but even
          with all the information we couldn&rsquo;t identify you if we wanted
          to.
        </p>

        <h3>What this means</h3>

        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s leave the metaphor and get back to reality. This is a
          broad overview: the mathematics behind our model can be found here.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you download our app, it will advertise that it&rsquo;s installed
          via Bluetooth to other phones in the area (the equivalent of saying
          &lsquo;I have the app!&rsquo; every few seconds). When it comes into
          contact with another phone giving off the same signal, the two will
          generate an entirely random number together (equivalent to having a
          private conversation where you choose a random word). This word is
          stored locally on both phones (in your private journal, and in
          theirs), and there it stays until the hopefully-unlikely event of a
          COVID-19 diagnosis.<br />
          When this happens, the relevant health authorities give you a key (the
          equivalent of a special envelope). In the US, this would currently be
          the CDC or state or local health departments; across different times
          and locations the relevant authority will vary. If you want to, you
          can tell the app that you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with COVID-19, and
          use the key to prove it. Importantly,
          <strong>this is your choice</strong>, although we would hope that the
          vast majority of users would do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          (The benefit of the key is that it prevents the network from being
          spammed by incorrect diagnoses, giving everybody false positives. The
          key prevents hoaxes, however, if there are many people in your area
          with COVID-19, hoaxes may become less relevant, and we could easily
          relax the requirements for a code to include self-diagnosis if this is
          the case.)
        </p>

        <p>
          We would then receive your &lsquo;journal&rsquo; (random number log).
          Depending on how we implement it, we would likely also receive your
          rough location and the day of the encounter, but these aren&rsquo;t
          essential to the basic model and we&rsquo;ll disregard them for now.
          We publish the list of random numbers, and every phone with the app
          will automatically check it at regular intervals to compare against
          their own diaries. If there&rsquo;s a match, they will get a push
          alert warning them that they&rsquo;ve been in contact with an infected
          individual and to act accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>Benefits</h3>

        <p>
          This system may seem unnecessarily complicated, but it fulfills one
          very basic goal that we feel is key to a truly secure and trustworthy
          app:
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">
          You don&rsquo;t have to trust us or anyone else for the system to
          work.
        </h2>

        <p>
          We like to think that we&rsquo;re pretty trustworthy individuals, but
          security is complicated and the world is messy. Perhaps our servers
          get illegally hacked, or legally subpoenaed - the end result is the
          same. Your data ends up in the hands of people who don&rsquo;t value
          your privacy as highly as you do. We want our system to be designed
          such that even if this happens, none of the information can be
          interpreted, so it can&rsquo;t be used against you or anyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the situation outlined above, the only information that leaves your
          phone is a list of random numbers, days, and broad geographic areas.
          Our servers don&rsquo;t contain any information on who these numbers
          were generated by, or even which numbers were generated by which
          phone. The most that can be derived from it is that some two unknown
          users were in roughly the same geographical area in the same 24-hour
          period.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if somebody gained access to the app on your phone, the only
          information stored are those random numbers and some vague
          spatiotemporal information: the exact same kind of information stored
          in far more detail by a range of other ubiquitous apps, such as most
          major map applications. Our app isn&rsquo;t storing any new
          information, beyond the fact that you were in proximity with some
          other user(s) of the app.
        </p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <p>
          This section addresses some potential questions and criticism of the
          plan. Many of these have come up in internal discussions and testing:
          if you have any questions that aren&rsquo;t answered to your
          satisfaction, feel free to send them to
          <a href="mailto:contact@covid-watch.org">contact@covid-watch.org</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >Doesn&rsquo;t this rely on a significant number of people
            downloading the app?</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, the Bluetooth contact tracing functionality does. This is a
          significant downside of it, and a major benefit of the GPS heatmap and
          epidemiological modelling functionality. These will add value to the
          user even if that user is the only person in the country with the app:
          this, in turn, should help spread the app to the point where Bluetooth
          becomes more useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >You talk about keys - doesn&rsquo;t that mean you need the CDC to
            help?</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          For the idea of authenticating keys to work, yes - we will need more
          institutional support, and we are actively working towards obtaining
          that. We could decide that the numbers of infections in an area no
          longer makes it necessary to require a key, and the system will still
          work, but as long as the number of cases is low in an area where
          testing is widely available, we would require a key to prevent hoaxes
          and false positives.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >You talk about privacy, but don&rsquo;t you collect GPS data? How
            is that private?</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          We&rsquo;re planning to only collect coarse-grained GPS data, that
          doesn&rsquo;t exactly pinpoint your location: perhaps only down to a
          square kilometre, for example. For most people, this is sufficiently
          anonymising: in urban areas there could be hundreds or thousands of
          people in that area, and the data we collect won&rsquo;t be able to
          distinguish you from those around you. For those people with highly
          distinctive travel patterns - say, spending every Thursday in a small
          town in rural France and every second Friday in a different small town
          in rural Sweden - this may be insufficient, and we&rsquo;re seeking
          security researchers in the field of data reidentification to look
          over this problem. However, since our security plan doesn&rsquo;t
          associate contact events with individual users, this problem is mostly
          (and maybe entirely) solved under our current plan. But we&rsquo;re
          double-checking this.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >I live in a rural area, where I&rsquo;m the only house within a
            square kilometre - if you use a square kilometre grid, I&rsquo;ll be
            the only person in my grid square. Won&rsquo;t I be identifiable on
            your app?</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The square kilometre example is for urban areas only. Our square size
          will be a function of density. For areas of lower population density,
          the resolution of the heatmap will be lowered proportionally to ensure
          that everyone is granted anonymity: an area with a population density
          a hundred times lower might have a resolution a hundred times coarser,
          to maintain the &lsquo;hundreds of people per grid square&rsquo; rule
          of thumb. To calculate population density, we&rsquo;re using
          NASA&rsquo;s
          <a href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4"
            >Gridded Population of the World</a

          dataset.

        <p><em>What challenges are you facing?</em></p>

        <p>
          The biggest specific challenge we&rsquo;re working on right now is
          navigating always-on Bluetooth. Most mobile operating systems
          discourage background apps using Bluetooth, as it tends to drain the
          battery. Firstly, we have to work around this discouragement;
          unfortunately, the status quo is the result of an arms race between
          apps and the mobile OS ecosystem which we&rsquo;re just entering.
          Secondly, it&rsquo;s discouraged for a reason - it really does drain
          phone batteries to use Bluetooth regularly, and we&rsquo;re finding
          out how best to balance this with functionality.
        </p>

        <p><em>Are there any scenarios in which my data is vulnerable?</em></p>

        <p>
          It&rsquo;s safe to assume that yes, a sufficiently dedicated and
          well-resourced actor can probably use generic smartphone data
          maliciously. For example, by accessing the phones of many users, an
          actor could find matching random numbers to work out who&rsquo;s been
          in proximity to who. At that point, though, it would be far easier and
          more lucrative for any such actor to exploit a range of other apps
          installed on the average phone, or the hardware of the device itself.
          We&rsquo;re confident that our app doesn&rsquo;t add any more to the
          minor threat of hacking someone already faces simply by owning a
          smartphone.
        </p>

        <p><em>Why are you so obsessed with privacy?</em></p>

        <p>
          The answer is two-fold.<br />
          Firstly, we believe that in the wrong hands, information can be
          dangerous. Specific location data can reveal your schedule, routine,
          and hobbies. A close analysis can reveal where you eat, sleep, work,
          and worship; it implies who you spend time with, as well as where and
          when that time is spent. We believe that you should have maximal
          control of this information, and with the development of
          <a
            href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-coronavirus-chinese-app-quarantine-color-code-2020-3"
            >similar but more invasive</a
          >
          programs to combat the spread of COVID-19 we worry that this belief
          may fall by the wayside. We don&rsquo;t want anyone to have to choose
          between their safety and their privacy; we believe that we can provide
          both.<br />
          Secondly, regardless of what we believe, many potential users care
          about privacy - particularly in states which have less rigorous legal
          frameworks around human rights. We want these individuals to feel
          safe. We want these individuals to be safe, from threats both as big
          as national governments and as small as a virus. A privacy-centred app
          is one that they can feel comfortable using - and the more users we
          have, the better off everybody is.

            it?</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          In many ways, they are! Our Bluetooth work has been heavily influenced
          by
          <a href="http://www.coepi.org/">CoEpi</a>, a similar group with
          similar goals and methodology. Similar doesn&rsquo;t mean exactly the
          same, however: their approach provides more functionality with
          slightly less focus on privacy. They are currently aiming to develop a
          user-centred app and gain grass-roots support, while we&rsquo;re
          pursuing a more top-down approach with institutional and hopefully
          government assistance that may lead to wider adoption. There are many
          different challenges both apps face on the road to adoption. We hope
          that by simultaneously working on these two paths to adoption we are
          increasing the likelihood of gaining wide-scale support from one of
          these apps in time - we both have the same goal to save lives.

        <p><em>This sounds great! Where can I sign up for more updates?</em></p>

        <h3>What next?</h3>

        <p>
          It&rsquo;s easy enough to talk about a hypothetical app, but building
          one - let alone one that helps people - takes effort and requires us
          to overcome several challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the short term, we&rsquo;re seeking researchers or experts in the
          following areas:<br />
          -Bluetooth<br />
          -Data reidentification<br />
          -App design (Android and iOS)<br />
          (If this sounds like you, or somebody you know, send us an email at
          <a href="mailto:contact@covid-watch.org">contact@covid-watch.org</a> -
          we&rsquo;d love to hear from you!)
        </p>

        <p>
          In the longer term, the looming challenge is institutional support
          from public health offices: the CDC or state/country equivalents
          globally, to both boost app usership and to validate diagnoses.
          We&rsquo;re aiming to develop a neatly packaged and functional app to
          present to these organisations, as well as a formal description of the
          technology we&rsquo;re using. It won&rsquo;t be easy - public health
          organisations are notoriously cautious, and in the case of COVID-19,
          slow adoption is only slightly more useful than no adoption at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nevertheless, we&rsquo;ve overcome several significant challenges to
          get to where we are, and none of the ones in front of us seem
          insurmountable. We&rsquo;re also continuing to gain interest and
          support: at last count, we&rsquo;ve had 39 people contribute in some
          way or another to the project from a range of fields and areas of
          expertise. Only time will tell, but we&rsquo;re increasingly
          optimistic.
