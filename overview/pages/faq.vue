Many groups, including Covid Watch, are working to make this a reality. However, our system does not strictly perform contact tracing. Users are not followed or tracked, and they are warned in an anonymous way. </p>" +
            "<p> We believe this will provide many of the benefits of contact tracing, as well as some additional ones. For example, we can more easily alert people when they have been in close contact with someone they don’t know (say, because you were riding a bus with them).

One major risk of COVID-19 in all countries is that it could overwhelm health systems, limiting their ability to care for people who desperately need it. By reducing infection rates we can space cases out slowly enough that hospitals worldwide can deal with them as they come, saving lives (often referred to as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.flattenthecurve.com/'>'Flattening The Curve'</a>).

Second, Bluetooth allows us to never store your data centrally. Instead, anonymized contact event numbers are stored on your own device.</p>" ,

The heatmap would show areas estimated to have a high risk of infection, based on the anonymized GPS location history and diagnostic status of our users. This would allow users to avoid such areas, and would compensate for some of the limitations of Bluetooth contact tracing (namely fomite transmission and the existence of non-users). </p>" +
          "<p>We still may build this, but GPS anonymization has proven to be a far more challenging problem than Bluetooth anonymization. It requires significant privacy tradeoffs, and based on feedback from contact tracers we've decided that this is a lower priority than our Bluetooth work. An algorithmic system of slicing and blurring the data is also needed to make sure that no user uploads a unique trajectory. Many such systems exist and we are actively investigating several of these in the hope of eventually re-introducing a privacy-respecting heatmap. </p>",
