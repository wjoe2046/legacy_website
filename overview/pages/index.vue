            <p>
              Covid Watch aims to empower people to protect their communities from COVID-19
              without sacrificing their personal privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our app uses Bluetooth signals to detect when users are in proximity to each other
              and alerts them anonymously if they were in contact with someone later confirmed to
              have COVID-19, without anyone (including the government) being able to track who
              exposed whom.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were among the first groups to release an <a href="https://github.com/Co-Epi/CEN/">
              open-source protocol</a> for privacy-preserving, decentralized Bluetooth contact
              tracing, and have been collaborating with MIT’s <a href="http://safepaths.mit.edu/">SafePaths</a>
              and <a href="https://www.coepi.org/">CoEpi</a> to make this protocol a standard
              across apps and jurisdictions. We are aiming to release the full app by mid-April.
